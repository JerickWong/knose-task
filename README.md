# How to run
## first.js and second.js
Using node, specify which file you wish to run
```bash
  node [file].js
```
## third.js
- For `third.js`, a short essay is found in the file as an overview of the implementation.

- There is no prompt, but instead modify the `arr` variable to test out the number of entries to be sorted.
- Likewise, run the file using node
```bash
  node third.js
```
